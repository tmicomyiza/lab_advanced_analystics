Certainly! Let's craft specific recommendations for both Jane and James based on their current portfolios, risk tolerance, and the rebalancing strategies we've discussed.

Jane's Portfolio:
Jane's portfolio is diversified across U.S. equities, ETFs, U.S. bonds, and international assets. Given the recent performance data:

U.S. Equities: With a YTD return of +10%, U.S. equities have shown decent growth. However, the international market (especially the VGTSX fund) has shown volatility in the past years.
ETFs: The ETFs have demonstrated strong performance recently with an 18.05% YTD market return.
U.S. Bonds: The YTD return on U.S. bonds is 4.25%, providing stability.
International Assets: The VGTSX fund has shown volatility, with negative returns in recent years.
Recommendations for Jane:

Aggressive Growth Strategy: If Jane has a high risk tolerance and a longer investment horizon, she could consider increasing her allocation in U.S. equities and ETFs. Reducing exposure to international assets, given their recent underperformance, might be prudent.

Moderate Growth Strategy: Jane can balance her portfolio by maintaining her U.S. equities allocation, slightly increasing her ETFs and U.S. bonds exposure, and decreasing her international assets allocation.

Conservative Growth Strategy: If Jane is risk-averse or nearing retirement, increasing her bond allocation while reducing equities and international assets exposure will offer more stability.

James's Portfolio:
James's portfolio is primarily in U.S. equities and ETFs.

U.S. Equities: With a YTD return of +10%, U.S. equities have shown good growth.
ETFs: ETFs in James's portfolio have shown strong performance with an 18.05% YTD market return.
Recommendations for James:

Aggressive Growth Strategy: James already has a significant allocation in U.S. equities. To further adopt an aggressive approach, he could increase his ETF holdings, especially those that focus on sectors or industries with high growth potential.

Moderate Growth Strategy: For a more balanced approach, James could consider diversifying into U.S. bonds for stability, while slightly reducing his U.S. equities exposure.

Conservative Growth Strategy: James should consider diversifying more into bonds and possibly international assets to reduce risk, while decreasing his U.S. equities allocation.

It's essential to note that these recommendations are based on fictitious data and general market trends up to 2023. Real-world investment decisions should be based on comprehensive financial advice and an in-depth analysis of the individual's financial situation and goals.
