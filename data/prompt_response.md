    Provided are the 10k SEC fillings for nvidia for fiscal years from 2019 through 2023. 
    Use the details in the "INCOME_STATEMENT" sheet from the Excel files to compare the performance. let's focus on the most recent fiscal years from  files and analyze key metrics such as:

    Revenue
    Cost of Revenue
    Gross Profit
    Operating Expenses
    Income from Operations
    Net Income

Response:
    I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems there was an error while attempting to merge and filter the data for key metrics across the different years. The issue is likely due to variations in the naming of the key metrics in the Excel files for different years.

    To proceed, I can:

    Display the index names for each year's data so that you can manually identify the key metrics, or
    Automatically attempt to find the closest matching index names for the key metrics across all years.
    Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
